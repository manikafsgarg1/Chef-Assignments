1. Worked with knife bootstrap windows command. As this was generating errors as it was not recieving any response from the node so for this issue I followed https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/issues/226 link and according to this I went to the node and then opened port 5985 and 5986 and after that I changed profile to  public  for "Windows Remote Management(HTTP-In) in the Inbound Rules". and after this steps it worked. Command worked is :

     ----   knife bootstrap windows winrm 54.173.184.247 --winrm-user "Administrator" -c ../.chef/knife.rb --no-name manik_ashwini


							or
RUN COMMANDS 

winrm quickconfig -q
winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP
winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="300"}'
winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM 5985" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=5985 action=allow
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM 5986" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=5986 action=allow
NetSh Advfirewall set allprofiles state off
net stop winrm
sc config winrm start=auto
net start winrm



2. Then I added --distro option to this command and checked to run template.erb file. For this I made an erb file and added text inside it. As I am not familiar with the syntax of erb file so I manually went to the node and set environment variables on powershell and than i run that command and it worked fine.

     ----  knife bootstrap windows winrm 54.173.184.247 --winrm-user "Administrator" -c ../knife.rb --no-name manik_ashwini --distro  templ.erb

To solve issue of knife bootstrap - https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/issues/226
 
Read about distro and how it works - https://docs-archive.chef.io/release/11-14/knife_bootstrap.html
Path to template.erb file - chef-repo/.chef/bootstrap/templ.erb

Note: --distro has been depreciated so it will be good to use --bootstrap-template instead of this thing.
