option to add unlimited:

  --credit-specification (structure)

	    The credit option for CPU usage of the instance. Valid values are standard and unlimited . To change this attribute after launch, use modify-instance-credit-specification . For more information, see T2 Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

    Default: standard

    Shorthand Syntax:

CpuCredits=string

JSON Syntax:

{
  "CpuCredits": "string"
}


Ruby:
{
	cpu_credits â‡’ String
}
Here string can be unlimited or standard	


We have to define CreditSpecification in the section where we define all the details of our instance like availability zone, image id, instance type, key kname, security group id and all.	


We have to make a class """"Class: knife::EC2::Types::CreditSpecification"""" 

CreditSpecification is just the name of a class where they have defined all the properties of the instance so therefore our main option is CPUCREDITS.

 you can check your T2 credit programmatically with the CPUCreditUsage and CPUCreditBalance CloudWatch metrics
